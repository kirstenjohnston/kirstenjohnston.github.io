## Welcome to my webiste

I investigate the resilience of marine communities to understand how organisms and people can adapt, react, and cope with a changing climate. Exploring this topic through different lenses including analyzing seagrass population data, monitoring harmful algal blooms and quantifying drivers of disease, I use field work, molecular techniques, and data science to support fisheries management recommendations.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kirstenjohnston/kirstenjohnston.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
