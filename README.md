## About

I investigate the resilience of marine communities to understand how organisms and people can adapt, react, and cope with a changing climate. Exploring this topic through different lenses including analyzing seagrass population data, monitoring harmful algal blooms and quantifying drivers of disease, I use field work, molecular techniques, and data science to support fisheries management recommendations.
